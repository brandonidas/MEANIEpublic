A web app I made in 2015 but just recently uploaded to github. It was a basic instagram clone with followers, notifications,
posts, a feed and profiles. The difference was that you could upload multiple pictures and have friends "vote" on them. Then
you could display a pie chart displaying the proportion of votes per option.

At the time, I pitched for and received Spring Singapore Small Project Funding of a few thousand dollars. I spent only a small
portion of it mostly on codeschool.com, small fiverr jobs and Amazon web services. I returned the rest of it.

MEAN.js - standing for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js. I used a CRUD generator for each module and sculpted it to
suit desired functionality.

Detailed instructions on how to run the app are soon to come.
